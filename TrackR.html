			<h1 class="header">React Native App</h1>
			<p>My group for our final project wanted to do a running app in react native. We taught ourselves react native to be able to create this. We only had about two weeks to prepare the app for the presentation on graduation day.</p>
			<p>We used React-Native, React-Native-Maps, Axios, React-Redux, Redux, Redux-Promise, React-Navigation, LoDash, React-Native-Vector-Icons, Haversine, and a few other small dependencies that helped along the way.</p>
			<p>The application it self tracks your run and tells you your distance of the run, calories burned, and path you took.</p>
