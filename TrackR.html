		<p>My group for our final project wanted to do a running app in react native. We taught ourselves react native to be able to create this. We only had about two weeks to prepare the app for the presentation on graduation day.</p>
		<p>We used React, React-Native-Maps, Axios, React Native, React-Redux, Redux, Redux-Promise, React-Navigation, LoDash, React-Native-Vector-Icons, Haversine, and a few other small dependencies that helped along the way.</p>
